### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Codes were written to calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.
