### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Codes were written to calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are given for all three cities by a bike share system provider named Motivate. The names of the files are listed below:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
Thanks to Udacity for creating the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree project!
