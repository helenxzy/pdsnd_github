### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Codes were written to calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities by a bike share system provider named Motivate. The names of the files are listed below:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
Thanks to Udacity for creating the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree project!
